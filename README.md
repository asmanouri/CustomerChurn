# CustomerChurn

The purpose of this project is to develop and design an effective and efficient model for customer churn prediction in telecommunication industry.

Churn prediction consists of detecting which customers are likely to cancel a subscription to a service based on how they use the service. We want to predict the answer to the following question, asked for each current customer: “ Is this customer going to leave us within the next X months?” There are only two possible answers, yes or no, and it is what we call a binary classification task. Here, the input of the task is a
customer and the output is the answer to the question (yes or no).
